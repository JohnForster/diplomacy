# Diplomacy

An implementation of the 1959 board game *Diplomacy* in Typescript. Uses Node.js, Express, Preact, MongoDB, Passport and Mongoose, many of which I had used before this project.

Still under development, but feel free to have a poke around the code.

```
yarn && yarn startDev
```

This is what it looks like at least:
